1. Change assign subject teacher function if not formerly properly implemented.
As teacher is assigned to subject, class to be taught is also indicated...

2. In fetching a subjects students, it's not put into consideration that not all classes offer the same
subjects. So there should be a way of saying this class offers this subject, but when assigning subject teacher,
you actually select the class and subject, so if a subject is not being offered by a class, you won't assign the
 class teacher at first. So problem solved.


3. Computing student position in class per subject, SUM function is giving me different values even for the same values
in argument though in different columns.. then i ceiled to 2dp
